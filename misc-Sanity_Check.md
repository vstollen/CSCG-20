# Writeup
In this challenge the description gave us two hints: The discord channel and something about memes.
So the obvious first step was to open the discord and look at some memes.
When looking through the discord for memes, there was one specific meme, which broke out of the `#memes'` channel and made it into `#ankündigungen`.
This meme also contained the flag in the bottom-right corner.
## Possible Risks
This is obviously a huge security thread, disrupting the productive work flow of fellow contenders and luring them into the `#memes` channel.
## Possible Fix
The possible fix would be not to mention `#memes` in the `ankündigungen` channel, so nobody would be disrupted.
